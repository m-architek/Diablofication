        <p>This component extend global script to apply spells regeneration spell on characters that are actually outside combat. 
            Check is performed every round, for each player and familiar individually. 
            Spells regeneration restores one arcane spell and one divine spell. 
            If more then one spell of type can be regenerated, higher level spell takes precedence.</p>

        <p>Component is using ActuallyInCombat trigger to check for combat presence. 
            Internally, this trigger using combat counter which count down 10 seconds after each attack. 
            This can allow to regenerate spells during combat when running away from enemy, 
            but this behavior is not completely deterministic.</p>
            
        <p>Spells regeneration is using opcode 261 to restore spells. 
            It seems to not work properly with sorcerers after level up 
            (rest is required to get access to new spell slots).</p>
