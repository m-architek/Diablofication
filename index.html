        href="https://github.com/m-architek/Diablofication/releases">Download</a>)<br />
      <strong>Game</strong>: BG1 EE v2.6 without SoD<br />

    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

    <p>Diablofication is Infinity Engine modification that aims to implement some of the mechanics known from Diablo games
      into Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition.</p>

    <p>Diablofication doesn't try to be total conversion mod. Instead, it tries to understand why certain mechanic is fun in Diablo 
      and introduce some changes to obtain similar result, without turning game upside down.</p>

    <p>Consequently, Diablofication is collection of components that focus on following aspects of the game:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Improvements for “no reload” gameplay, including ones that make this style of playing available for less
          experienced players.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Randomization and diversification of game content.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Various hack'n'slash flavored changes, especially focused on increasing game dynamics.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>See <a href="#components">components list</a> for more details about mod content.</p>

    <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

    <p>Unpack mod archive in main game directory. Run setup-Diablofication.exe and follow instructions on the screen.
      For deinstallation reverse steps of installation process. Run setup-Diablofication.exe and choose [U]ninstall
      option. After process finish, you can remove mod files from your game directory.</p>

    <p>See <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/33164-a-new-player%E2%80%99s-guide-to-installing-and-playing-mods"
      >here</a> for more details about installing and playing Inifnity Engine modifications.</p>

    <p>Some of mod components requires <a href="https://eeex-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">EEex</a> to show their full potential. 
      For getting access to all those additional features it is advised to install EEex before Diablofication. 
      Diablofication was tested with EEex version v0.9.19-alpha, please use this version of EEex or later.</p>

    <h2 id="compatibility">Compatibility</h2>

    <p>Diablofication is using <a href="https://weidu.org/~thebigg/README-WeiDU.html">WeiDU</a> 
      for patching game files in a way that will be compatible with patches done by other WeiDU based modifications. 
      However, this not guarantee flawless in-game experience in every setup, 
      so if you plan to install Diablofication together with other mods, 
      please read following notes about cross-mod compatibility and installation order.</p>

    <p>Diablofication should be installed possibly late in mods installation process (preferably as the last mod). 
      It tries to detect changes done by other modifications and act accordingly to provide best possible compatibility.</p>

    <p>Each Diablofication component makes changes in different aspect of the game. 
      Most common source of incompatibility could be to install Diablofication component together with other mod that changes same thing in different way.
      Detail compatibility notes are maintained per each component individually, please read them before installation.</p>

    <p>Most of Diablofication components do not require starting new game to work properly and can be safely installed or uninstalled during playthrough. 
      Exceptions from this behavior are stated in compatibility notes of particular components.</p>

    <h2 id="components">Components</h2>

    <p>Diablofication consists of several components. All components are optional and can be installed independent from each other. 
      However, it is also possible to install them all, what allows to enjoy full Diablofication experiance.</p>

      progression rules or HP of companions, like "Max HP at Level One", "Higher HP on Level Up", "Allow HP Rolls Through Level 20 [Angel]", 
      "Maximum HP Creatures [the bigg]" (in "all" or "party-joinable NPCs" variants) from <a
        href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/tweaks/tweaks/">Tweaks Anthology</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> This component ignores "Maximum HP" game option. It always calculates HP using "Maximum HP"
      rule.</p>

    <p>See <a href="./docs/level1_hp.html">here</a> for more details.</p>

    <br />

    <h3 id="camera-lock">Camera Lock (Beta)</h3>

    <p>Double click on character portrait locks camera, making it move automatically with character movement, 
      keeping character always in the center of the screen. 
      You can unlock camera using right click on "select all" button.</p>

    <p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> This component should be installed after UI overhaul mods and after every mod 
      that add new cutscenes. Besides that there is no other compatibility restriction.</p>

    <p><strong>Limitations:</strong> If <a href="https://eeex-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">EEex</a> not installed, 
      camera lock is performed using character action list. That means, if character is in the middle of some action, 
      like movement or spell casting, camera locked will be delayed until action finish. 
      <a href="https://eeex-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">EEex</a> allows for overcome this limitation. 
      Additionally, it allows to perform camera lock on party leader after double click on "select all" button.
      In multiplayer game, camera unlock not work properly for players other then host, unless EEex is installed.</p>

    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Move your character using right click button to avoid group select when view is still in
      move.</p>

    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> View movement is much smoother on higher framerate. You can adjust framerate by editing
      "Maximum Frame Rate" option in Baldur.lua config file (you can find it next to your save games).
      Note that this setting changes overall game speed.</p>

    <p>See <a href="./docs/camera_lock.html">here</a> for more details.</p>
