    <p><strong>Version:</strong> v0.2 (<a
        href="https://github.com/m-architek/Diablofication/releases">Download</a>)<br />
      <strong>Game</strong>: BG1 EE v2.6 without SoD<br />
      <strong>Platform:</strong> Windows<br />
      <strong>Language:</strong> Universal (no new lines added)
    </p>

    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

    <p>Diablofication is Infinity Engine modification that aims to implement some of the mechanics known from Diablo II
      into Baldur's Gate games series.</p>

    <p>Diablo II and Baldur's Gate are two very different games. Diablofication doesn't try to change that by being
      total conversion mod. Instead, it tries to understand why certain mechanic is fun in Diablo II and introduce
      changes to Baldur's Gate to obtain the same result, without turning game upside down.</p>

    <p>Consequently, Diablofication is collection of tweaks that focus on following aspects of the game:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Improvements for “no reload” gameplay, including ones that make this style of playing available for less
          experienced players.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Randomization and diversification of game content.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Various hack'n'slash flavoured changes, especially focused on solo playthrough.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>See <a href="#components">components list</a> for more details about mod content.</p>

    <p>Diablofication tries to maintain compatibility with other mods by following best modding practices joined
      together with “maximum effect at minimum cost” rule. See <a href="#compatibility">compatibility section</a> for
      more details.</p>

    <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

    <p>Unpack mod archive in main game directory. Run setup-Diablofication.exe and follow instructions on the screen.
      For deinstallation reverse steps of installation process. Run setup-Diablofication.exe and choose [U]ninstall
      option. After process finish, you can remove mod files from your game directory.</p>

    <p>See <a
        href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/33164-a-new-player%E2%80%99s-guide-to-installing-and-playing-mods">here</a>
      for more details about installing and playing Inifnity Engine modifications.</p>

    <p>Some of mod components require starting new game to work properly. This also means that after mod
      deinstallation, using saves made when those components was yet installed can lead to unexpected issues.
      For details, see descriptions of particular component.</p>

    <h2 id="compatibility">Compatibility</h2>

    <p>Diablofication is using WeiDU for patching game files in a way that will be compatible with patches done by other
      WeiDU based modifications. However, this “technical” compatibility not guarantee flawless in-game experiance so
      please read following notes about cross-mod compatibility and installation order.</p>

    <p>Diablofication is tweak collection mod and should be installed possibly late in mod installation process
      (preferably as the last mod). It tries to detect changes done by other modifications and acts accordingly to
      provide best compatibility.</p>

    <p>Each Diablofication component makes changes in different aspect of the game, detail compatibility notes are
      maintaied per each component indyvidually, please read them before installation. Moreover, some Diablofication
      components will refuse to install if they will detect incompatibility with one of already installed mod (this
      feature is obviously limited only to some of the most popular modifications).</p>

    <h2 id="components">Components</h2>

    <p>Diablofication mod consists of following components. All components are optional and independent from each other.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="#character-respawn">Character Respawn</a></li>
      <li><a href="#character-view-lock">Character View Lock</a></li>
    </ul>

    <br />

    <h3 id="character-respawn">Character Respawn (Alpha)</h3>

    <p>In case of Protagonist death, entire party will be resurrected in nearest temple (or in other sensible place if
      temple is currently unavailable). This will however has consequence in certain amount of gold and experience
      points loss.</p>

    <p><strong>Motivation:</strong> This component is designed to allow “no reload” play style for less experianced
      players. You can now play “no realod” and your character death will have certain consequences, but it will not end
      your playtrough. If you always wanted start playing “no realod”, but you were intimidated by too severe
      consequence of your eventual mistake, this component is exactly for you. It can also be useful if you already play
      “no reload” and enjoy it, but you want to make it more casual and open for experiments.</p>

    <p><strong>Installation:</strong> This component should be installed after every mod that add new areas, items or
      spells. Starting new game is required for this component to work properly.</p>

    <p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Resolving respawn place cannot work perfect in mod-added areas, it is advised to
      visit closest non-mod
      area before traveling there. Sometimes this component can produce strange results together with mods that add
      complex plot (e.g. when you die in mod-added area that is no longer reacheble from nearest temple, what makes
      impossible to finish your quest). In case of such problems, you can always fallback to standard “reload” approach
      for this part of the game. In general, taking into account current stage of development, it is advised to save
      game normally, and just not reload it, unless some unpredicted problem occurs. This component is not compatible
      with mods that make changes related to Protagonist death like “Death Cam” component of <a
        href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/tweaks/tweaks/">Tweaks Anthology</a> or <a
        href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/28910-protagonist-can-die/page/2/#comment-280191">Protagonist
        Can Die</a> tweak.</p>

    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Protagonist doesn't drop eqipment in the moment of death. However, enemies and party
      members still do.
      In case that battlefield is unaccessible or far away from respawn point, it can result with loot or equipment
      lose.</p>

    <p>See <a href="./docs/character_respawn.html">here</a> for more details (this can include spoilers).</p>

    <br />

    <h3 id="character-view-lock">Character View Lock (Alpha)</h3>

    <p>Locks game viewport on Protagonist. Viewport will move automatically with your character movement,
      keeping character always in the center of the screen.</p>

    <p><strong>Motivation:</strong> Moving view automatically together with character movement saves you tedious view
      scrolling, especially when playing solo.
      It also has its specific flavour by allowng you to experinace game more from your character perspective.</p>

    <p><strong>Installation:</strong> This component should be installed after every mod that add new cutscenes.
      Starting new game is not required.</p>

    <p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> This component most likely wouldn't be compatible with other mods that change
      game viewport behavour.</p>

    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Move your character using right click button to avoid group select when view is still in
      move.</p>

    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> You cannot use map screen to move your view on the other side of the area,
      but you can still zoom out to travel greater distance with less clicks.</p>

    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> View movement is much smoother on higher framerate. You can adjust framerate by editing
      "Maximum Frame Rate" option in Baldur.lua config file (you can find it next to your save games).
      Note that this setting changes overall game speed.</p>

    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> This component significantly reduces your scouting ability. You can scout using your
      companions, familiar or scouting spells like Wizard Eye or Farsight only as far as you can zoom out.</p>

    <p>See <a href="./docs/character_view_lock.html">here</a> for more details.</p>
