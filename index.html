        href="https://github.com/m-architek/Diablofication/releases">Download</a>)<br />
      <strong>Game</strong>: BG1 EE v2.6 without SoD<br />
      <strong>Platform:</strong> Windows<br />
      <strong>Language:</strong> English, Polish
    </p>

    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

    <p>Diablofication is Infinity Engine modification that aims to implement some of the mechanics known from Diablo games
      into Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition.</p>

    <p>Diablofication doesn't try to be total conversion mod. Instead, it tries to understand why certain mechanic is fun in Diablo 
      and introduce some changes to obtain similar result, without turning game upside down.</p>

    <p>Consequently, Diablofication is collection of components that focus on following aspects of the game:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Improvements for “no reload” gameplay, including ones that make this style of playing available for less
          experienced players.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Randomization and diversification of game content.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Various hack'n'slash flavored changes, especially focused on increasing game dynamics.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>See <a href="#components">components list</a> for more details about mod content.</p>

    <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

    <p>Unpack mod archive in main game directory. Run setup-Diablofication.exe and follow instructions on the screen.
      For deinstallation reverse steps of installation process. Run setup-Diablofication.exe and choose [U]ninstall
      option. After process finish, you can remove mod files from your game directory.</p>

    <p>See <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/33164-a-new-player%E2%80%99s-guide-to-installing-and-playing-mods"
      >here</a> for more details about installing and playing Inifnity Engine modifications.</p>

    <p><strong>Warning:</strong> It is advised to install Diablification before starting new game and keeping it installed for whole playtrough.
      Deinstallation of the mod during playthrough can leave your saved games in invalid state.</p>

    <h2 id="compatibility">Compatibility</h2>

    <p>Diablofication is using <a href="https://weidu.org/~thebigg/README-WeiDU.html">WeiDU</a> 
      for patching game files in a way that will be compatible with patches done by other modifications. 
      However, this not always guarantee flawless in-game experience in every setup. 
      If you plan to install Diablofication together with other mods, it is best to install it possibly late in mods installation 
      process (preferably as the last mod). Diablofication tries to detect changes done by other modifications 
      and act accordingly to provide best possible compatibility. Additional compatibility notes can be found 
      together with components description.</p>

    <h2 id="components">Components</h2>

    <p>Diablofication consists of several components. All components are optional and can be installed independent from each other. 
      However, it is also possible to install them all and enjoy full Diablofication experience.</p>

      Caster receives special ability, that can be used to teleport party back to the place where Town Portal spell was casted. 
      Town Portal spell scrolls are added to store in every temple. These scrolls can be used to cast Town Portal spell be every character 
      that meets standard requirements for using scrolls (regardless of ability to use arcane magic).</p>
            
    <p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Town Portal would work correctly on areas added by other mods, if installed after them.</p>
      
    <br />

    <h3 id="identification">Identification For All</h3>

    <p>This component changes Identify spell scrolls so they can be used be every character that meets standard requirements for using scrolls 
      (regardless of ability to use arcane magic). Also, Identify scrolls are added to store in every temple.</p>
            
    <p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Component would affect temples added by other mods, if installed after them.</p>
      
    <br />

    <h3 id="party-revive">Party Revive After Combat (Beta)</h3>

    <p>Makes all forms of death of all party members (including protagonist) temporary until the end of combat.
      Game over occurs only when all characters have been eliminated.</p>

    <p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> This component should be installed after every mod that add new items or spells. 
      It is not compatible with “Death Cam” component of <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/tweaks/tweaks/">Tweaks Anthology</a>.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> You can still bring party members back to life during combat by using proper spell or abilities like 
      "rise dead" spell or "flesh to stone" scroll.</p>

    <br />

    <h3 id="character-respawn">Character Respawn (Beta)</h3>

    <p>Instead of game over, entire party will be resurrected in the nearest temple (or other safe place, if temple is unreachable). 
      This will however has consequence in certain amount of gold and experience points loss.
      After respawn, protagonist receives special ability, that can be used to teleport party back to the place where respawn was triggered.</p>

    <p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> This component should be installed after every mod that add new areas, items or spells. 
      It is not compatible with “Death Cam” component of <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/tweaks/tweaks/">Tweaks Anthology</a>.</p>

    <br />

    <h3 id="noncombat-xp">Remove Non-Combat Experience</h3>

    <p>Removes experience points rewards from quests, dialogues, thief ability usages and spells learning.</p>

    <p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Component would affect experience rewards from quests and dialogues added by other mods, if installed after them.</p>

    <br />

    <h3 id="scale-enemies">Scale Enemies With Party Size (Beta)</h3>

    <p>Adjusts enemies hit points and experience rewards to current party size. 
      Scaling is performed only once, right after creature spawn. 
      That means once adjusted values will not change again, even if party size change.</p>

    <p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Component would affect enemies added by other mods, if installed after them.</p>

    <br />

    <h3 id="spells-regen">Spells Regeneration (Beta)</h3>

    <p>Grants out of combat regeneration of one spell (arcane and divine) per round for all party members (including familiars).</p>

    <p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> This component has no compatibility restrictions.</p>

    <br />

    <h3 id="level1-hp">More HP on Level One</h3>

    <p>Significantly increases HP amount that protagonist and all companions receives on level one.
      At the same time, amount of HP gained with every level is decreased, so difference between HP from
      original rules and those applied by this component is getting smaller with every level up.</p>

    <p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> This components would recalculate initial HP of companions added by other mods only 
      if installed after them. Note that HP progression rules would apply to every character, regardless of mod installation order. 
      That means companions added after this component would suffer both low initial HP and low HP progression. 
      This component will not be compatible with modifications that alters HP progression rules or HP of companions, 
      like "Max HP at Level One", "Higher HP on Level Up", "Allow HP Rolls Through Level 20 [Angel]" or 
      "Maximum HP Creatures [the bigg]" from <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/tweaks/tweaks/">Tweaks Anthology</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> This component ignores "Maximum HP" game option. It always calculates HP using "Maximum HP" rule.</p>

    <br />

    <h3 id="proficiency">More Proficiency Points</h3>

    <p>Increases frequency of getting weapon proficiency points, especially for fighters and other classes that are good with weapons.</p>

    <p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> This component has no compatibility restrictions.</p>

    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Component doesn't change starting proficiency points of companions. 
      They will however use new progression rules on every level up.</p>

    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Despite having spare proficiency points, you won't be able to unlock next level of weapon mastery faster 
      then in original rules.</p>

    <br />

    <h3 id="camera-lock">Camera Lock (Beta)</h3>

    <p>Double click on character portrait locks camera, making it move automatically with character movement, 
      keeping character always in the center of the screen. 
      You can unlock camera using right click on "select all" button.</p>

    <p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> This component should be installed after UI overhaul mods. 
      It would not affect negatively cutscenes added by other mods, if installed after them.</p>

    <p><strong>Limitations:</strong> By default, camera lock is performed using character action list.
      That means, if character is in the middle of some action, like movement or spell casting, 
      camera lock will be delayed until action is finished.       
      <a href="https://eeex-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">EEex</a> allows to overcome this limitation. 
      Additionally, it allows to perform camera lock on party leader after double click on "select all" button.
      Also, in multiplayer game without EEex, camera unlock on "select all" right click not work for players other then host.
      If you want to use Camera Lock with EEex, please make sure to install EEex before Camera Lock.
      Component was tested with EEex version v0.9.19-alpha, please use this version of EEex or later.</p>

    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Move your character using right click button to avoid group select when view is still in
      move.</p>

    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> View movement is much smoother on higher framerate. You can consider adjusting 
      game framerate by editing "Maximum Frame Rate" option in Baldur.lua config file (you can find it next to your saved games). 
      Note that this setting changes overall game speed.</p>
