    <p><strong>Version:</strong> v0.5-SNAPSHOT (<a
        href="https://github.com/m-architek/Diablofication/releases">Download</a>)<br />
      <strong>Game</strong>: BG1 EE v2.6 without SoD<br />
      <strong>Platform:</strong> Windows<br />
      <strong>Language:</strong> Universal (no new lines added)
    </p>

    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

    <p>Diablofication is Infinity Engine modification that aims to implement some of the mechanics known from Diablo games
      into Baldur's Gate games series.</p>

    <p>Diablofication doesn't try to be total conversion mod. Instead, it tries to understand why certain mechanic is fun in Diablo 
      and introduce some changes to Baldur's Gate to obtain similar result, without turning game upside down.</p>

    <p>Consequently, Diablofication is collection of tweaks that focus on following aspects of the game:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Improvements for “no reload” gameplay, including ones that make this style of playing available for less
          experienced players.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Randomization and diversification of game content.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Various hack'n'slash flavored changes, especially focused on solo playthrough.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>See <a href="#components">components list</a> for more details about mod content.</p>

    <p>Diablofication tries to maintain compatibility with other mods by following best modding practices. 
      Also, it tries to provide maximum effect at minimum cost by avoiding risky changes when it is not justified. 
      See <a href="#compatibility">compatibility section</a> for more details.</p>

    <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

    <p>Unpack mod archive in main game directory. Run setup-Diablofication.exe and follow instructions on the screen.
      For deinstallation reverse steps of installation process. Run setup-Diablofication.exe and choose [U]ninstall
      option. After process finish, you can remove mod files from your game directory.</p>

    <p>See <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/33164-a-new-player%E2%80%99s-guide-to-installing-and-playing-mods"
      >here</a> for more details about installing and playing Inifnity Engine modifications.</p>

    <p>Some of mod components requires <a href="https://eeex-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">EEex</a> to show their full potential. 
      For getting access to all those additional features it is advised to install EEex before Diablofication. 
      Diablofication was tested with EEex version v0.9.19-alpha, please use this version of EEex or later.</p>

    <p>Some of mod components require starting new game to work properly. This also means that after mod
      deinstallation, using saves made when those components was yet installed can lead to unexpected issues.
      For details, see descriptions of particular component.</p>

    <h2 id="compatibility">Compatibility</h2>

    <p>Diablofication is using <a href="https://weidu.org/~thebigg/README-WeiDU.html">WeiDU</a> 
      for patching game files in a way that will be compatible with patches done by other WeiDU based modifications. 
      However, this “technical” compatibility not guarantee flawless in-game experience so please read 
      following notes about cross-mod compatibility and installation order.</p>

    <p>Diablofication is tweak collection mod and should be installed possibly late in mod installation process
      (preferably as the last mod). It tries to detect changes done by other modifications and act accordingly to
      provide best possible compatibility.</p>

    <p>Each Diablofication component makes changes in different aspect of the game, detail compatibility notes are
      maintained per each component individually, please read them before installation.</p>

    <h2 id="components">Components</h2>

    <p>Diablofication mod consists of following components. All components are optional and can be installed 
      independent from each other.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="#character-respawn">Character Respawn (Beta)</a></li>
      <li><a href="#noncombat-xp">Remove Non-Combat Experience</a></li>
      <li><a href="#level1-hp">More HP on Level One</a></li>
      <li><a href="#camera-lock">Camera Lock (Beta)</a></li>
    </ul>

    <br />

    <h3 id="character-respawn">Character Respawn (Beta)</h3>

    <p>In case of protagonist death, entire party will be resurrected in nearest temple (or in other sensible place, if
      temple is currently unavailable). This will however has consequence in certain amount of gold and experience
      points loss.</p>

    <p><strong>Motivation:</strong> Allowing for "no reload" playthrough in more forgivable manner.</p>

    <p><strong>Installation:</strong> This component should be installed after every mod that add new areas, items or
      spells. Starting new game is required for this component to work properly.</p>

    <p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Resolving respawn place cannot work perfect in mod-added areas, it is advised to
      visit closest non-mod area before traveling there. Sometimes this component can produce strange results together with mods
      that add complex plot (e.g. when you die in mod-added area that is no longer reachable from nearest temple, what makes
      impossible to finish your quest). In case of such problems, you can always fallback to standard “reload” approach
      for this part of the game.
      In general, it is still advised to save game once in a while, and just not reload it, unless some unexpected problem occurs.
      This component is not compatible with mods that make changes related to protagonist death like “Death Cam” component of <a
        href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/tweaks/tweaks/">Tweaks Anthology</a> or <a
        href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/28910-protagonist-can-die/page/2/#comment-280191">Protagonist
        Can Die</a> tweak.</p>

    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Protagonist doesn't drop equipment in the moment of death. However, enemies and party
      members still do.
      In case that battlefield is inaccessible or far away from respawn point, it can result with loot or equipment
      lose.</p>

    <p>See <a href="./docs/character_respawn.html">here</a> for more details (this can include spoilers).</p>

    <br />

    <h3 id="noncombat-xp">Remove Non-Combat Experience</h3>

    <p>Removes experience points rewards from quests, dialogues, thief ability usages and spell learning.</p>

    <p><strong>Motivation:</strong> Removal of "free" XP in early parts of the game. Reducing overall XP amount for solo playthroughs. 
      Increased freedom in picking dialogue options for powergamers.</p>

    <p><strong>Installation:</strong> This component should be installed after every mod that adds new quests and dialogues.
      Starting new game is not required.</p>

    <p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> This component will not be compatible with every modification that alters XP rewards, 
      like XP adjustments components from <a href="https://rawgit.com/K4thos/EET_Tweaks/master/EET_Tweaks/readme-EET_Tweaks.html"
      >EET Tweaks</a> (excluding those related to combat XP).</p>

    <p>See <a href="./docs/noncombat_xp.html">here</a> for more details (this can include spoilers).</p>

    <br />

    <h3 id="level1-hp">More HP on Level One</h3>

    <p>Significantly increases HP amount that protagonist and all companions receives on level one.
      At the same time, amount of HP gained with every level is decreased, so difference between HP from
      original rules and those applied by this component is getting smaller and smaller with every level up.</p>

    <p><strong>Motivation:</strong> Adding more hack'n'slash flavor to early portion of Baldur's Gate.</p>

    <p><strong>Installation:</strong> This component should be installed after every mod that adds new companions.
      Starting new game is required for this component to work properly.</p>

    <p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> This component will not be compatible with every modification that alters HP
      progression rules or HP of companions, like "Max HP at Level One", "Higher HP on Level Up", "Allow HP Rolls Through Level 20 [Angel]", 
      "Maximum HP Creatures [the bigg]" (in "all" or "party-joinable NPCs" variants) from <a
        href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/tweaks/tweaks/">Tweaks Anthology</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> This component ignores "Maximum HP" game option. It always calculates HP using "Maximum HP"
      rule.</p>

    <p>See <a href="./docs/level1_hp.html">here</a> for more details.</p>

    <br />

    <h3 id="camera-lock">Camera Lock (Beta)</h3>

    <p>Double click on character portrait locks camera, making it move automatically with character movement, 
      keeping character always in the center of the screen. 
      You can unlock camera using right click on "select all" button.</p>

    <p><strong>Motivation:</strong> Moving camera automatically together with character movement saves tedious view
      scrolling, especially when playing solo.
      It also brings additional immersion by allowing you to experience game more from your character perspective.</p>

    <p><strong>Installation:</strong> This component should be installed after UI overhaul mods and after every mod 
      that add new cutscenes. Starting new game is not required.</p>

    <p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> This component most likely wouldn't be compatible with other mods that change
      game camera behavior.</p>

    <p><strong>Limitations:</strong> If <a href="https://eeex-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">EEex</a> not installed, 
      camera lock is performed using character action list. That means, if character is in the middle of some action, 
      like movement or spell casting, camera locked will be delayed until action finish. 
      <a href="https://eeex-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">EEex</a> allows for overcome this limitation. 
      Additionally, it allows to perform camera lock on party leader after double click on "select all" button.</p>

    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Move your character using right click button to avoid group select when view is still in
      move.</p>

    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> View movement is much smoother on higher framerate. You can adjust framerate by editing
      "Maximum Frame Rate" option in Baldur.lua config file (you can find it next to your save games).
      Note that this setting changes overall game speed.</p>

    <p>See <a href="./docs/camera_lock.html">here</a> for more details.</p>
